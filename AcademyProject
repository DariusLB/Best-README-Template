Gallery Saver – Project

Story and user needs.

Develop a web application to consume the {JSON} Placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) in order for a user to be able to create entities named "Photo Albums" in which you can add photos. You are always able to add or remove albums as a user. Inside an album you can also edit the Title of the photo album and you can add or remove photos. For each photo you can also add and remove comments.

* AC = Acceptance Criteria

The API that you will use in order to make requests is here https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.
Please read the documentation, how each route can be accessed and what you can do with them.
The routes that you will need are /albums (representing galleries), /photos, /posts.
