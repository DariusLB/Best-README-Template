    Develop a web application to consume the {JSON} Placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) in order for a user to be able to create entities named "Photo Albums" in which you can add photos. You are always able to add or remove albums as a user. Inside an album you can also edit the Title of the photo album and you can add or remove photos. For each photo you can also add and remove comments.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I have created two interfaces in html, named indexAlbum.html and indexPhoto.html. 
In the first page, Photo Viewer, there are 4 buttons:
  * a button for viewing all the albums that are automatically generated from tipycode usign the albums resource from JSONPlaceholder
  * a button for creating a new album
  * a button for updating the title of an album
  * a button to delete an album
  * 
(For the create, update and delele button, you can only see the results in the console of the page)

In the second page, Photo Viewer, there are also 4 buttons:
  * a button for viewing all the albums that are automatically generated from tipycode usign the albums resource from JSONPlaceholder
  * a button for creating a new album
  * a button for updating the title of an album
  * a button to delete an album
  * for the upload a photo from computer I have created a form with two input forms, a button to submit and a button and an input form for an image
(For the create, update and delele button, you can only see the results in the console of the page)
(After completing the title and comment input forms and after pressing the submit button, the data will be showed on the screen underneath)
(For uploading a photo from computer, I have only a button that uploads the picture in the image input form that I have created)

### Built With

* [Popper.js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js/2.10.2)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
For completing this project I used the free fake API named [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) from typicode. For using this, I needed the fetch API function. 
I have used the [albums](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) and [photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos).
